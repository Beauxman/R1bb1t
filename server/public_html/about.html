						<h2 class="header-text-2">About us</h2>
						<h2 class="header-text-3">Mission Brief</h2>
						<p>R1bb1t.com is a social media application developed by Andrew Bowman to demonstrate how modern tools and frameworks can be used to make effective and useful web applications without the need for extremely exhaustive budgets or development teams.</p>
						<p>By providing users the ability to create, share, and connect with one another, R1bb1t achieves many of the core paradigms necessary to making a modern social media platform.</p>
						<h2 class="header-text-3">Creator</h2>
						<p class="center-text">R1bb1t was created by Andrew Bowman.</p>
						<img class="title-logo" src="client_art/andrew_bowman.jpg">
						<p class="center-text">Andrew is a computer programmer and graduate of California State University, Fullerton, receiving his Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science.</p>
						<p>He enjoys making all sorts of projects and is constantly looking to learn new technologies and expand his knowledgebase.</p>
						<p>Contact:<br>Email: <a>andrewasus@gmail.com</a><br>LinkedIn: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-bowman-45a4b7288/">Link</a></p>
						<h2 class="header-text-3">A Social Media Network</h2>
						<p class="center-text">Post, Share, Like, Follow</p>
						<p>An essential part of every social media platform is the ability for users and content creators to express themselves and their thoughts in a easy and intuitive way. Technology is supposed to make this process as simple and understandable as possible for the end-user.</p>
						<p>Programmers are the ones that bridge the gap between complicated technologies and everyday people looking to post about their day.</p>
						<h2 class="header-text-3">Technologies Used</h2>
						<p>Languages: <br>- HTML, CSS, Javascript, SQL</p>
						<p>Front-end frameworks and libraries: <br>- Boostrap V3, AJAX, JQuery, Moment.js</p>
						<p>Back-end frameworks and libraries: <br>- NodeJS, MySQL, Apache</p>
						<h2 class="header-text-3">Lessons Learned</h2>
						<p>Making this application was a very educational experience. R1bb1t is heavily inspired by Twitter and implementing some of the features of that platform required research and problem solving.</p>
						<p>The process taught that knowledge of long-standing technologies is important, but also, being able to quickly learn and integrate new technologies on the fly is vital to programming.</p>
						<h2 class="header-text-3" id="support">Support</h2>
						<p>R1bb1t is constantly in development and receiving new features.</p>
						<p>For any bugs, inqueries, or requests, please contact Andrew at his email address (<a>andrewasus@gmail.com</a>).</p>
						<p class="text-center">Thank you!</p>
